# Simple Terminal-Based Text Editor

A simple terminal-based text editor built in Python from scratch using only the `curses` library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zai-kun/simple_py_text_editor
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd simple_py_text_editor
   ```

3. Run the editor:
   ```sh
   python main.py <file_name_here_to_edit>
   ```

Replace `<file_name_here_to_edit>` with the name of the file you want to edit.

Note: This project was built only for learning purposes. I wouldn't recommend anyone to actually use it as a daily driver.
